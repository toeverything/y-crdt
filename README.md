# Y CRDT

It's a collection of Rust libraries oriented around implementing [Yjs](https://yjs.dev/) algorithm and protocol with cross-language and cross-platform support in mind. It aims to maintain behavior and binary protocol compatibility with Yjs, therefore projects using Yjs/Yrs should be able to interoperate with each other.

Project organization:

- **lib0** is a serialization library used for efficient (and fairly fast) data exchange.
- **yrs** (read: *wires*) is a core Rust library, a foundation stone for other projects.
- **yffi** (read: *wifi*) is a wrapper around *yrs* use to provide a native C foreign function interface. See also: [C header file](https://github.com/y-crdt/y-crdt/blob/main/tests-ffi/include/libyrs.h).
- **ywasm** is a wrapper around *yrs* that targets Web Assembly and JavaScript API.

Other projects using *yrs*:

- [ypy](https://github.com/y-crdt/ypy) - Python bindings.
- [yrb](https://github.com/y-crdt/yrb) - Ruby bindings.
